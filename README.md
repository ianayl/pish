# Pish - POSIX Interactive Shell

Pish is an interactive shell that strives to be friendly, _somewhat_ fast and
POSIX compliant for once.

# Massive Disclaimer:

This shell is in it's _extreme infant stages_, and I am a beginner to
programming and beginner to C, so bare with me here if I make cringy mistakes. 
A bit of an ambitious project, but I'm hoping to bust my legs into C with this
project. 

Bit of a bad idea? Maybe, but whatever, I'm already here, so I might as well 
continue it.

## Motivation

For some reason, a lot of "friendly" interactive shells aren't POSIX compliant?
Take example:
- Fish
- Elvish

Now, Zsh does exist, but it doesn't have the nice things fish has without 
plugins or OMZ. The plugins don't quite hit the same spot that the features
built into Fish however though, and while OMZ is nice, it's _really slow_ 
unfortunately.

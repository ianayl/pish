# Ship - SHell, but Interactive and Posix compliant this time.

Ship is an interactive shell that strives to be friendly, _somewhat_ fast and
POSIX compliant for once.

## Massive Disclaimer:

This shell is what I would call a "research" project. It's not "research" as 
in breaking new grounds, its honestly just for me to learn how to make 
languages and such. It's also in it's _extreme infant stages_, and I am a 
beginner to programming and beginner to C, so bare with me here if I make 
cringy mistakes. A bit of an ambitious project, but I'm hoping to bust my 
legs into C with this project. 

Bit of a bad idea? Maybe, but whatever, I'm already here, so I might as well 
continue it.

## Motivation

For some reason, a lot of "friendly" interactive shells aren't POSIX compliant?
Take example:
- Fish
- Elvish

I don't quite get it. I quite like having my interactive shell be POSIX 
compliant. I know POSIX compliancy doesnt make for easy to use syntax, but it
does make scripting POSIX stuff a lot easier in my opinion because you can test
things by throwing it in your shell. Plus, POSIX compliancy also promises that
your shell will work with practically any shell script, thus explaining why I 
want a POSIX interactive shell.

Now, Zsh does exist, but it doesn't have the nice things fish has without 
plugins or OMZ. The plugins don't quite hit the same spot that the features
built into Fish however though, and while OMZ is nice, it's _really slow_ 
unfortunately. Hence I am going to learn how to program a shell just so I
can have a comfy shell experience.
